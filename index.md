## About Me:

I am a [Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Ocean and Earth Sciences, University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/62h5qp/doctor-aditya-narayanan). I am currently studying the role played by large-scale oceanic circulation in mediating heat supply towards the Amundsen Sea as part of the [DeCAdeS project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FT012803%2F1).

I am also a visiting fellow at UNSW, Sydney.
